Attributes

    **Scenario as an object**
        Scenario is an object that exists in the computer's temporary memory (RAM). It can be considered as the a concept that wraps an instance of the energy system class plus the inputs.
        However, it could be saved to the permanent memory by saving the data the object holds to disk as a file of an appropriate format.

Actions
^^^^^^^

1. Scenario can be saved to disk through the *load scenario* view component in the Scenarios view
2. Multiple scenario objects can be created during the simulation using the *create scenario* view component in the Scenarios view
3. Multiple scenario objects can be compared in the *scenario comparison* view


Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The objects must be accessible to other relevant view components
2. External scenario objects created in other software that are to be imported into open_plan should adhere to the data standards
3. Should be saved to disk in an appropriate format before exiting the tool in order to be accessible later
